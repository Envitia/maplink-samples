<h2>WMS and WMTS services</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms">OGC Web Map Service (WMS)</a> is a protocol for service georeference map data via a standard http connection.  Map images are generated by a WMS server and made available for client applications to display.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts">OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)</a> is a protocol for serving pre-rendered map tiles at specific zoom scales.  Normally a WMTS service is quicker than a WMS as the pre-rendered tiles can be cached as part of the http requests.  
<p>
Both types of service can provide access to multiple different maps, which are published as seperate layers, in order for the client to request the relevant map data.  The services allow the client to specify the format for the returned images (JPEG, PNG, etc.), and to specify other settings such as background transparency.

<p>
The WMS/WMTS viewer application uses the Maplink Pro SDKs to implement a client for both services.  The interface consists of the main map display(2), which provides common interaction modes for the data, and the Services tree view(1) which allows the loaded services and their layers to be modified.
<h3>Adding a new service</h3>
<p>
To add a WMS/WMTS service to the viewer, select the 'Service->Add Service' menu entry, or use the toolbar button(3).
<p>
When entering the service address, it should be entered without any additional WMS/WMTS parameters.  For example 'http://www.example.com/wms?'
For WMS servers, some additional options are available.<br>  
The swap X/Y axis option is only for use with non-compliant WMS servers, when using the EPSG:4326 or CRS:84 coordinate systems.  If the loaded data doesn't appear in the correct location, this option may allow layers from the server to be displayed correctly.
<p>
If a service requires basic http authentication, a dialog will be shown to allow entry.  The entered credentials will be cached for the services domain, but may be cleared via the general options dialog.
<p>
If the service supports multiple coordinate reference systems (CRSs), it will allow one to be selected.  Once a CRS has been selected it must be selected for all of the services, in order for the maps to align correctly.
<h3>Managing loaded services</h3>
<p>
Once services have been added via the wizard, they may be modified by right clicking on the entry in the services tree.  The layers displayed for each services may be added/removed as necessary, and the transparency of each service may be modified via the 'properties' context menu entry.  Services can be re-ordered by dragging them to the relevant location in the tree view, and the map view can be zoomed to any selection of services/layers.
